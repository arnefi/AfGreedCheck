[WildStar](http://www.wildstar-online.com)-Addon

## Description

See who selected need or greed at a glance.

![Main Window](http://fs1.directupload.net/images/150128/q3cleht6.jpg)

When you're doing Dungeons and Adventures in PUGs you can now see at once who presses "need" on everything or who didn't select anything.

After installation you can configure it by typing `/afraid` in any chat window or using the ESC-Menu. The window will only appear, when you're in a group and loot for all drops. You can reach the configuration window from there, too.
